**INITIAL CONDITION:**

The plant was healthy when I received it and it put on the windowsill that got the most sunlight. 

**RECOMMENDED CARE**

According to the Morton Arboretum, the Coralberry thrives under full sun or partial sun/shade for around 6 hours daily. It grows best in well drained soil but is not picky. Some potential problems are mildew, anthracnose, aphids and scale.

**ACTUAL CARE**

Following the guidance given, I left it on the windowsill and watered it when I remembered. The container drained well so the soil never stayed too wet.

**PROBLEMS I FACED**

I did not face any problems with disease or insects. Due to how well the plant thrived even under neglect sometimes I forgot to water it and the leaves became very droopy. My forgetfulness turned out to be the main problem I faced.

However, the plant recovered very quickly after some emergency watering.

Another problem was that many of the interior leaves could not get any sunlight and slowly shriveled away. Due to their position, these were also different to reach for removal.

**RESULTS**

 The coralberry survived and thrived and was joined by mainy other plants on the windowsill.![A picture containing table, plate, plant  Description automatically generated](./plant_family.jpg)

**CONCLUSIONS**

My plant lived because I did not completely forget about it and it is naturally very hardy and resilient.
